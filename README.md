# path-codegen

A simple CLI tool to generate a nested path object from a directory structure.

## Description

This tool scans a given directory and creates a TypeScript/JavaScript file that exports a constant object containing all the paths within that directory. This allows you to reference your project's assets and files in a type-safe way, preventing typos and errors from broken paths.

The generated object mirrors the directory structure, and the keys are derived from the file and directory names.

## Usage

You can run this tool directly using `npx` without any installation.

```bash
npx path-codegen <source-directory> [options]
```

### Arguments

-   `<source-directory>`: (Required) The path to the directory you want to scan.

### Options

-   `-o, --output <file>`: The name for the generated output file. (Default: `path-codegen.ts`)

## Example

Given a directory structure like this:

```
assets/
├── images/
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── icons/
│       └── home.svg
└── README.md
```

Running the following command:

```bash
npx path-codegen assets -o src/generated/paths.ts
```

Will generate the following file at `src/generated/paths.ts`:

```typescript
// This file is auto-generated by path-codegen. Do not edit.

export const ASSETS = {
  README: "/README.md",
  images: {
    icons: {
      home: "/icons/home.svg"
    },
    logo: "/images/logo.png"
  }
} as const;
```
